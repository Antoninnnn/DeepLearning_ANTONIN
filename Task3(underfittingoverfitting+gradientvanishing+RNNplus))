overfitting&underfitting

notes:

1. K-fold cross-validation
2. methodes to reset ultraparameters
3. L2 norme regularisation(the set of lamdha)
4. torch.optim.SGD
5. 𝐸(ℎ′𝑖)=𝐸(𝜉𝑖)/(1−𝑝)*ℎ𝑖=ℎ𝑖

Gradient vanishing and exploration

notes:

1. definition
2. the significance for initializing different parameters.
3. 3 kinds of derivations
4. the prediction of house price.

RNNplus

notes:
1. the principal for GRN
2. what need to be initialized in GRN
3. the same as LSTM, Deep RNN and interacted RNN.
